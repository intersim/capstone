  <h2>Create a Mix</h2>
  
  <p>Mixes allow you to combine Loops in multi-track compositions. Each Mix is 16 measures long and can contain up to 4 tracks.</p>

  <h4>Add Loop to Mix</h4>
  <p>To add a loop to a Mix, click <strong>Open Loop Bucket</strong>. Your Loop Bucket contains all of the Loops you've created or saved to it. Click and drag a loop to copy it from the Loop bucket, then drop it in a measure in one of the Mix's tracks.</p>

  <h4>Add a New Track</h4>
  <p>Click the <strong>Add Track</strong> button to add a new track to your composition.</p>

  <h4>Remove a Loop from Mix</h4>
  <p>To remove a Loop, click and drag the Loop, and a Trash area will appear in the bottom right corner of the screen. Just drop the Loop in that corner, and it will be removed from your composition.</p>
  <p>Deleting a Loop on the Mix page does not remove it from your Loop bucket, just from the Mix.</p>

  <h4>Playback</h4>
  <p>Click the <button class="btn btn-primary btn-xs" title="play"><span class="fa fa-play"></span></button> button to hear your Mix start playing.
  <p>Click the <button class="btn btn-primary btn-xs" title="stop"><span class="fa fa-stop"></span></button> button to stop playback.


  <h4>Save a Mix</h4>
  <p>Once you're ready to save your Mix, click the <button class="btn btn-primary btn-xs" title="save"><span class="fa fa-floppy-o"></span></button> button, fill out details about your Mix in the form, and then click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>
