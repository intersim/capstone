# Symph - Draw Your Music
============

Symph is a music creation platform for music enthusiasts of all levels. Symph can be used as a tool to learn basic composition skills and to draft composition mock-ups. You can view the deployed version at getsymph.io

We used ToneJS, FabricJS, and native HTML5 Drag and Drop (DnD) API and Csanvas.

Using ToneJS has allowed us to synthesize sound within your browser, reducing latency that comes with downloading mp3 and .wav files before being able to play them. With Symph, you can turn your browser into an instrument!
