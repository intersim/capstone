# Symph - draw your music.
============

Symph is a music creation platform for music enthusiasts of all levels. Symph can be used as a tool to learn basic composition skills and to draft composition mock-ups. 

Using ToneJS has allowed us to synthesize sound within your browser, reducing latency that comes with downloading mp3 and .wav files before being able to play them. With Symph, you can turn your browser into an instrument!

To use:

- First things first, make an account to create loops, mixes and share them with other users.
- Navigate to the Loop Editor page and click on our interractive grid to start making music.
- Save your loops as well as those of others to your loop bucket and navigate to the Mix Editor page to create your first tune.


Features
============
- Loop Creator and Editor - the grid was rendered with HTML5 canvas and fabricJS. To create a note, simply click on a desired cell. The y axis represents the note's pitch: the higher the cell, the higher the note. The x axis represents beats per minute with the current default being an 8th note. To extend a note, click it and drag it in the desired direction. To move a note, select it and place it on the desired space on the grid. To delete, select the note and click the delete button.

Your notes will light up from left to right as they play so you can follow the progression of your tune.

If you're satisfied with your composition, click the floppy disc to save.

- Sharing and Collaboration - browse loops and mixes pages feature the work of other users that you can edit and use in your own creations.
